## Implementation Plan
We have implemented and tested the new APASP algorithms, comparing them against baseline shortest path algorithms to evaluate performance in different graph settings (dense and sparse graphs).

### Key Components:
1. **New APASP Algorithm**
   - Implemented the algorithm as per the paper's pseudocode
   - Optimized performance for different graph types
   - Created specialized test graph generators to showcase algorithm properties
2. **Baseline Comparisons**
   - Implemented Floyd-Warshall as the baseline exact APSP algorithm
   - Compared time complexity and accuracy with detailed metrics
3. **Experimental Analysis**
   - Conducted tests on synthetic graphs of various sizes and densities
   - Evaluated efficiency and approximation accuracy with comprehensive metrics

### Core Concepts from the Paper:
- **Multiplicative 2-approximation:** Ensures the estimated distance between any two vertices is at most twice the true shortest path.
- **Algorithmic Improvements:** The paper introduces two new algorithms:
  - **Faster algorithm** for computing multiplicative 2-approximations with time complexity Ã•(min{n^(1/2)m, n^(9/4)}).
  - **Distance-sensitive algorithm** for vertex pairs with distances â‰¥ 4, achieving Ã•(min{n^(7/4)m^(1/4), n^(11/5)}) expected time.

These improvements provide better efficiency compared to previous methods, such as those based on Fast Matrix Multiplication (FMM).

## Latest Results
Our implementation has yielded several key findings:

### Key Findings
1. The speedup factor increases with graph size, reaching approximately 8x for graphs with 200 vertices
2. The approximation algorithm clearly demonstrates the theoretical time complexity advantages
3. Current implementation occasionally exceeds the theoretical multiplicative-2 bound in certain test cases
4. The algorithm performs better on sparse graphs than dense graphs in terms of approximation quality

## Technical Challenges & Solutions
We've addressed several key challenges during implementation:

1. **Hitting Set Construction:** We implemented a hybrid approach combining deterministic and probabilistic methods to balance accuracy and performance.

2. **Zero Error Issue:** Our initial implementation computed exact distances rather than approximations. We addressed this by introducing appropriate approximation for longer distances.

3. **Test Graph Generation:** We created specialized test graph generators that ensure connectivity and create structures with long paths to better demonstrate the algorithm's behavior.

4. **Approximation Guarantee:** We identified issues with maintaining the theoretical multiplicative-2 bound and are working on refining the implementation to strictly adhere to this guarantee.

## Experimental Setup
We tested our implementations on various graph types:

- **Synthetic Graphs:** 
  - Sparse graphs with long paths
  - Dense graphs with clear cluster structures
  - Connected random graphs with varying edge probabilities

Our benchmarks measure both runtime efficiency and approximation quality across different graph sizes, with multiple trials to ensure stable results.
