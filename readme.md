# All Pairs Approximate Shortest Paths (APASP) Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing new algorithms for the **All Pairs Approximate Shortest Paths (APASP)** problem in unweighted, undirected graphs. The selected paper introduces improved algorithms for APASP that do not rely on Fast Matrix Multiplication (FMM), targeting better time complexity for dense graphs.

## Implementation Plan
We will implement and test the new APASP algorithms, comparing them against baseline shortest path algorithms to evaluate performance in different graph settings (dense and sparse graphs).

### Key Components:
1. **New APASP Algorithm**
   - Implementing the algorithm as per the paperâ€™s pseudocode
   - Optimizing performance for different graph types
2. **Baseline Comparisons**
   - Implementing traditional All-Pairs Shortest Path (APSP) algorithms
   - Comparing time complexity and accuracy
3. **Experimental Analysis**
   - Running tests on synthetic and real-world graph datasets
   - Evaluating efficiency and approximation accuracy
